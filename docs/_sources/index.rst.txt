Welcome to the OPF Specification! Here you will find the official documentation and resources for the Open Photogrammetry Format (OPF).

What is OPF?
==============

OPF is the specification for a standardized file format designed for photogrammetry data.
The specification is open and free and aims at making it easy to store, exchange, and collaborate on photogrammetric data between different parties and software products.
Typically, a project is made of a "project container" file (`.opf`) which references the other project components, such as the files storing the camera parameters or point clouds.

Features
==========

- Based as much as possible on simple human readable JSON files, leverage efficient binary formats where a text-based representation would be impractical (for example for the point cloud data)
- OPF organizes photogrammetry data in a structured manner, allowing for easy access and retrieval of information.
- The data model includes information on both input and output of the photogrametry process:

   - The input data include information about input cameras (camera list, input camera parameters), coordinate reference system, control points, scale and orientation constraints, etc.
   - The output data include information about camera calibration (sparse point cloud, calibrated cameras) and the dense reconstructed point clouds.

- Efficient Storage of point clouds: The point cloud format for ATPs (sparse point cloud) and dense point cloud included in this specification is based on the open standard `GlTF <https://www.khronos.org/gltf/>`_ and is designed to be memory-mappable and spatially partitioned, enabling both efficient processing and progressive rendering of massive point clouds. The format retains information on the point visibiliy on images, normals, custom attributes, and more.
- Flexible Extension System: OPF is designed to be highly extensible and customizable, allowing for easy expansion of data representation as needed.
- OPF will be improved on an on-going basis to support additional photogrammetric outputs.
- OPF is a stable format: it has strict schema semantic versioning rules, giving strong compatibility guarantee and peace of mind for the implementers. JSON schemas are provided for validation.
