# Vanishing points

This page specifies the data model and format for vanishing points.

Project item type: `ext_pix4d_vanishing_points`.

Resource format string: `application/ext-pix4d-vanishing-points+json`.

Required sources for the `pix4d_vanishing_points` item in the project container:
* `camera_list`
* `calibration`
* `scene_reference_frame`

## Definition

A **vanishing point** is defined by its 3D coordinates only, expressed in the [processing CRS](glossary.md#processing-crs).
An image may contain many vanishing points.

A group of parallel lines in 3D projected on an image under a pinhole camera model intersect in a common point. This point
is a **vanishing point**.

In many scenes, structurally important lines have the same vanishing point because they are
parallel in 3D. Examples of such lines are horizontal and vertical building edges, railways tracks, doors and windows, etc.

Please refer to [Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications](https://www.cs.ccu.edu.tw/~damon/tmp/SzeliskiBook_20100903_draft.pdf)
section 4.3.3 for more information about vanishing points and their uses.

## File Format

The vanishing points are stored in the JSON file format.
