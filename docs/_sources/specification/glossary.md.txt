## Definitions

### Canonical reference system

A right-handed, isometric variation of a Cartesian coordinate reference system.

### Coordinate reference system (CRS)

Following the EPSG definition, a coordinate reference system or CRS "consists of one coordinate system that is related to an object through one datum".
It allows describing spatial positions on the object of interest unambiguously.

### Processing CRS

A canonical CRS plus a translation defined by a project's scene reference frame.
The translation is meant to move the centroid of the project close to (0, 0, 0) for numerical stability during processing and visualization.

### Scene reference frame

A base CRS and a transformation to its translated canonical form.

### Spatial reference system

See coordinate reference system.
