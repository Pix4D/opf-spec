# Scene reference frame project item

A scene reference frame project item identifies and describes the coordinate system and reference frame used by other project items.
In most cases the project item will contain a single resource pointing to a JSON file, but the resource list could also be empty.

* Item type `scene_reference_frame`
* Neither required nor optional source item types.
* Resource formats:
  | required | optional |
  | -------- | -------- |
  |  | [`application/opf-scene-reference-frame+json`](application/opf-scene-reference-frame+json-format)<br> |

An empty resource list indicates that nothing is known about the coordinate system and reference frame, i.e. neither the geolocation nor the scale of the axes are known.
When the scale is known but the reference frame is arbitrary, it is preferable to include a description that contains an <a href="https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html#88">engineering coordinate reference system </a> in its definition as described in the resource format specification.
Notice that many other items still require a scene reference frame as a source item.
The purpose of linking project items to an empty scene reference frame is to denote that all items linked to the same frame have consistent coordinates.
This is possible because every scene reference frame item has a different UUID that identifies it.

## Examples

```json
{
    "id": "4049924c-5fed-440d-bae3-1b54869fb4e2",
    "type": "scene_reference_frame",
    "name": "Unknown reference frame for dataset X",
    "sources": [],
    "resources": []
}
```

```json

    "id": "ea9c18a5-3c7a-4f16-b54c-b122bc413e68",
    "type": "scene_reference_frame",
    "sources": [],
    "resources": [
        {
            "uri": "processing_spatial_reference.json",
            "format": "application/opf-scene-reference-frame+json"
        }
    ]
