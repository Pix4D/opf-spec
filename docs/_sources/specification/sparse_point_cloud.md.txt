# Calibration sparse point cloud

The calibration sparse point cloud is stored into the [OPF-glTF point cloud format](point_cloud.md).

It must contain, in addition to 3D positions, extra matching information that is:
* The match index range for each point
* The match camera ids
* The match image point with content:
  * The image point pixel coordinates
  * The image point feature index
  * The image point scale
  * Optionally if the calibration used depth information, the image point depth
